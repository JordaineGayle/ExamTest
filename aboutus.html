            <br><br>
            <p>Way back some 20 (twenty) years ago I was a student at a High School in 
            St. Catherine I believe at that time I had access to the best teachers money 
            could afford, but then something very wrong had happened , the best teachers 
            migrated to teach outside of Jamaica. That was one of the biggest hurt that 
            affected Jamaica and even know I still do not think Jamaica and other countries
            that had this brain drain has fully recovered and from there I began to think how
            can I ensure the lives of student could be changed so after many years of thinking 
            I have come up with a solution that would help our student to because experts
            in the area of study.</p><br>
            <p>After teaching Information Technology for some years I recognized that there is 
            more to be done to reach out to student in the education system and I believe that
            it all begins with us</p><br>

            way for students in the Caribbean to prepare and study for their CXC Exams. </p><br>
